# Niall, Archie, and Robin's Game
Let's Make a Thing!

# Rules
1. If it's a private variable or function put an underscore('_') before it's name.
2. If it's a function make sure the first letter of the name is capitalized.

E.G:

private int _imAPrivateInteger; 

private void _ImAPrivateFunction();

3. Don't commit broken code.
4. Take criticism.
